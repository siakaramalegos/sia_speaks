# Sia Speaks

Hello, I'm a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies based in New Orleans. I'm also a [Women Techmakers](https://www.womentechmakers.com/) ambassador and co-organizer for [GDG New Orleans](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-new-orleans/). As a developer, I love building things that help make people's lives easier. As a person, I also love making developer's lives easier through teaching, speaking, and mentoring. You can find more information about me and the topics I speak about here. I currently talk about more JavaScript and front-end topics such as JavaScript, front-end performance, and React. Would you like me to speak at one of your events? <a href="mailto:sia@clioandcalliope.com">Email me</a>, or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thegreengreek)!

## Current Active Topics

### Modern JavaScript for Modern Browsers

More developers are starting to understand that web performance matters. From higher mobile search rankings to bottom-line revenue impacts, performance can make or break your web app. However, fixing performance can feel like a quagmire of expert-level nuanced understanding on so many topics. What would you think if I told you you could cut your JavaScript bundle size up to 50% by doing one thing only? Nearly 90% of worldwide web traffic runs on modern browsers, but we're transpiling all of our JavaScript down to ES5. That transpilation has a cost. In this talk, we'll learn about differential serving, or serving modern bundles to modern browsers and legacy, transpiled bundles to older browsers. We'll talk about strategies, what to watch out for, and how to implement it using webpack. This talk is framework agnostic, and it's best if you have at least a basic understand of JavaScript.

### The Future of Front-End Performance
Help! My app bundle is 5MB! My users are angry that my app is so slow! It’s easy to forget that performance matters when we are under pressure to deliver features quickly. What data should we use to inform our decisions? From code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking to bundle analysis, progressive rendering, and modern transpiling, come learn how you can deliver a better experience to your users with high-performing front-end apps. This talk is library-agnostic (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).

### #IamRemarkable Workshop

[#IamRemarkable](https://iamremarkable.withgoogle.com/) is a Google initiative empowering women and underrepresented groups to celebrate their achievements in the workplace and beyond. This 90-minute workshop highlights to participants the importance of self promotion in their careers and provides them with the tools to practice this skill. I am an official #IamRemarkable facilitator.

### Hint, hint, perf matters!

Resource hints are a cool way to play tricks with latency to load web applications faster. Come learn all about resource hints as we apply them to Google Fonts to make them faster.

### Get in the Fast Lane: Measuring Web Performance
(Workshop) Are you losing revenue to performance? 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load. Pinterest reduced load times by 40% and saw a 15% increase in sign ups. Starbucks implemented a 2x faster time to interactive resulting in a 65% increase in rewards registrations. AliExpress reduced load by 36% and saw a 10.5% increase in orders.

Performance is important. Tooling can be hard. Do flame charts intimidate you? Come learn how to audit and fix common performance issues using Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and webpagetest.org. 

See the full description [here](https://gist.github.com/siakaramalegos/4621a71df28d5f163f3ca7a52a0edcb0).

### Responsive Images
Images account for more than 40% of the bytes downloaded to load a website. How can you make sure that your users only download the smallest image necessary while preserving image quality? Which file formats suit which image types best? How can you use art direction in images to show the best image for a viewport layout? Come learn about this an more! A basic understanding in HTML and CSS is required to get the most out of this talk. (Can be easily converted to a workshop)

### Performance and Real User Monitoring
What is Real User Monitoring versus Synthetic Testing in the realm of front-end performance? What are some of the tools available to measure both? In this talk we'll do an overview of measurement methods and do a deep-dive on the Navigation, Resource, and User Timing APIs.

### Getting to Know Webpack 4 Workshop

Are you afraid of your build tool? Fret no more. Come learn the basics of Webpack, using the new version 4. We'll learn about the new features such as sensible defaults as well as the core features. During this half-day workshop, we will build a simple application using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and images to understand all parts of setting up the build tool.

### Universal React Apps Using Next.js

Every user’s hardware is different, and processing speed can hinder user experience on client-side rendered React applications. Server-side rendering and code-splitting can drastically improve user experience by minimizing the work that the client has to do. It’s easy to get lost in the lingo, so come learn what it all means and how to easily build universal React apps using the Next.js framework. We’ll walk through the concepts and use code examples to cement your understanding. You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re comfortable with React and ES6 syntax.

### Next-level React Workshop: React Router, Redux and More

Come learn about intermediate to advanced topics for building real-world ReactJS Web applications in this full-day workshop. We will start by learning about the core fundamentals of Redux including pure functions, actions, reducers, the store, and subscriptions. Then we will integration Redux into a React app, learning about components vs containers, accessing the store, async actions, middleware, and thunks. Next, we will layer in React Router 4, learning about params, queries, and redirects; prompt before navigation, and scrollToTop. Time permitting and based on audience preferences, we can learn about using component libraries, styling, ES6+, and more! Basic knowledge of React is required for this workshop.
