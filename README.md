## Current Active Topics

### Front-End Performance Still Matters (_new!_)
Help! My app bundle is 5MB! My users are angry that my app is so slow! It’s easy to forget that performance matters when we are under pressure to deliver features quickly. What data should we use to inform our decisions? From code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking to bundle analysis, progressive rendering, and modern transpiling, come learn how you can deliver a better experience to your users with high-performing front-end apps using Webpack. This talk is library-agnostic (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).

### Don't Unmount Your Whole App: Error Boundaries in React 16 (_new!_)

One of the major changes in React 16 is how errors are handled. Now, errors not caught by an error boundary will cause the whole app to unmount! So what is an error boundary? How is it implemented? Where should you put them? Why did Facebook do this? Come learn about how error boundaries help avoid crashed apps, improve user experience, and more.

### Getting to Know Webpack 4 Workshop (_new!_)

Are you afraid of your build tool? Fret no more. Come learn the basics of Webpack, using the new version 4. We'll learn about the new features such as sensible defaults as well as the core features. During this workshop, we will build a simple application using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and images to understand all parts of setting up the build tool.

### Universal React Apps Using Next.js

Every user’s hardware is different, and processing speed can hinder user experience on client-side rendered React applications. Server-side rendering and code-splitting can drastically improve user experience by minimizing the work that the client has to do. It’s easy to get lost in the lingo, so come learn what it all means and how to easily build universal React apps using the Next.js framework. We’ll walk through the concepts and use code examples to cement your understanding. You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re comfortable with React and ES6 syntax.

### Intro to React Workshop

Level up your front-end development skills using React! React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and one of the hottest front-end libraries currently used in modern web development. Come learn what this library is all about and how we can build simple, declarative user interfaces using components.

In the time-honored tradition of our people, we will start with a Hello World app but quickly move forward with learning JSX, or JavaScript XML, rendering and components, events and state, lifecycle methods, state in large applications, and using APIs in React. On top of that, we will learn all the relevant ES6 features that are widely used in the React community.

### Intro to Redux for React Apps Workshop

Once you have a solid foundation in React, it quickly becomes clear that managing state in larger applications can be challenging. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. Redux makes scaling React applications easier. Come learn about this popular state management library and level up your React development skills!

The first part of this workshop will focus on the core functionality of Redux - pure functions, actions, reducers, and the store. After we build that foundation, we will layer in the React-Redux bindings and learn about components vs containers, building containers, accessing the store, async actions, middleware, thunks, hydrating data, and server-side fetching using Node + Express.

### Archived Talks

#### No REST for the weary... Introducing GraphQL

RESTful APIs can make fetching data pretty hairy sometimes, but fetching data doesn’t have to be so difficult. Enter GraphQL… the query language where you can ask for exactly what you need with a single HTTP request. Come learn what all the buzz is about!

What is GraphQL? How does it differ from REST? In this session, I’ll answer these questions as well as give you an overview of the ecosystem. Of course, an introduction would not be complete without a demonstration of how to use GraphQL, including queries, resolving, integrating into a front-end app, and more!  

You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re familiar with JavaScript and ES6 syntax. You’ll get all the fancy concepts you need through code examples. The last part of the demo will show integration with a React app, but it’s not critical that you know React to learn the fundamentals of GraphQL from this session.

#### Lightning Fast React Apps

App loading and run-time affect your bottom line. Fancy features aren’t worth anything if users leave the app out of frustration. Every second counts! React is super fast, but you could be shooting yourself in the foot with design decisions. Come learn how to make your React apps lightning fast!

Page abandonment increases with every second of load time. Also, profiling and debugging performance issues can seem like an overwhelming topic to learn. In this session, we’ll cover the usual suspects of performance issues, from the basics of using the correct build, to the fundamentals of immutable data, to higher-level tools like Perf, shouldComponentUpdate, PureComponent, and memoizing computed props in Redux. 

We will both cover the concepts and walk through examples step-by-step so that by the end of this session you will feel like a React Speed Racer. You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re at least comfortable with React and ES6 syntax.
