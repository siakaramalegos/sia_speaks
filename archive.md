## No REST for the weary... Introducing GraphQL

RESTful APIs can make fetching data pretty hairy sometimes, but fetching data doesn’t have to be so difficult. Enter GraphQL… the query language where you can ask for exactly what you need with a single HTTP request. Come learn what all the buzz is about!

What is GraphQL? How does it differ from REST? In this session, I’ll answer these questions as well as give you an overview of the ecosystem. Of course, an introduction would not be complete without a demonstration of how to use GraphQL, including queries, resolving, integrating into a front-end app, and more!  

You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re familiar with JavaScript and ES6 syntax. You’ll get all the fancy concepts you need through code examples. The last part of the demo will show integration with a React app, but it’s not critical that you know React to learn the fundamentals of GraphQL from this session.

## Lightning Fast React Apps

App loading and run-time affect your bottom line. Fancy features aren’t worth anything if users leave the app out of frustration. Every second counts! React is super fast, but you could be shooting yourself in the foot with design decisions. Come learn how to make your React apps lightning fast!

Page abandonment increases with every second of load time. Also, profiling and debugging performance issues can seem like an overwhelming topic to learn. In this session, we’ll cover the usual suspects of performance issues, from the basics of using the correct build, to the fundamentals of immutable data, to higher-level tools like Perf, shouldComponentUpdate, PureComponent, and memoizing computed props in Redux. 

We will both cover the concepts and walk through examples step-by-step so that by the end of this session you will feel like a React Speed Racer. You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re at least comfortable with React and ES6 syntax.
